# MMD - Modular Monolith Design

MMD or modular monolith design is an approach to develop modular monolith in a sistematic way. It's based on consolidated backgrounds like Domain Driven Design (http://dddcommunity.org), Enterprise Application Architecture Patterns (https://martinfowler.com/articles/enterprisePatterns.html), SOLID and Object Oriented principles. More than just declaring itself based on Domain Driven Design, MMD proposes to be a more prescriptive DDD specialization in even more specific scenarios.

## MMD Application Scenarios

MMD should be applied in projects involved in complex needs. Since MMD and DDD are tightly closed, we could say that MMD could be applied in the same scenarios in which DDD applies. There is a quantitative indicator of DDD applicability in the Vaugh Vernon's red book (https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577). The method is available here: https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1944876&seqNum=2. Despite of your project's complexity, MMD'patterns can be isolated applied ever they make sense. Look at the patterns described in this document, their applicability and use them if you you think it makes sense to your project.
 
## MMD Objectives

The MMD's objectives are listed below:

1) Enable writing code ready to change

Software changes should not 



1. Different business contexts implementations
